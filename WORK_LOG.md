| Sept 24th | 11:00am - 12:00pm | Mr. Blick taught us that binary search isn't the most efficient way to solve this problem. I confirmed with Mr. Blick that I need to have an arraylist of all of the misspelled words and then convert it to a 1D string once I finish the problem. On top of that, I wrote a quick checker that only adds misspelled words into the misspelledWords arraylist if that misspelled word isn't currently in the arraylist. |
| Sept 26th |  8:45am - 9:55am  | I used this class period to add some comments to my code and added where I would put my helper function that will get called to check to see if a word is valid. On top of that, I started thinking about how to approach solving this problem. I created a couple of examples and tried to find the most efficient way to check if it's valid or not. |
| Sept 27th |  7:15pm - 7:45pm  | I continued trying to figure out my own algorithm that would be better from binary search. I tried writing random words and then starting at different positions at that word to then check it against the dictionary list. I think that even with an algorithm, there is some luck about how fast the program will be as if the 2nd letter doesn't match any words, then it's automatically not a word. |
| Sept 27th |  9:00pm - 9:45pm  | After trying to find a way to solve the better problem than binary search manually, I attempted to googled some ways. I didn't really find anything that made clear sense to me though. I am super curious for Mr. Blick to tell us what algorithm we should use in class (hopefully I was close)! |
