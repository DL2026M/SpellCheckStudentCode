| Sept 24th | 11:00am - 12:00pm |                                     Mr. Blick taught us that binary search isn't the most efficient way to solve this problem. I confirmed with Mr. Blick that I need to have an arraylist of all of the misspelled words and then convert it to a 1D string once I finish the problem. On top of that, I wrote a quick checker that only adds misspelled words into the misspelledWords arraylist if that misspelled word isn't currently in the arraylist. |
| Sept 26th |  8:45am - 9:55am  |                                                                                                       I used this class period to add some comments to my code and added where I would put my helper function that will get called to check to see if a word is valid. On top of that, I started thinking about how to approach solving this problem. I created a couple of examples and tried to find the most efficient way to check if it's valid or not. |
| Sept 27th |  7:15pm - 7:45pm  |                                                     I continued trying to figure out my own algorithm that would be better from binary search. I tried writing random words and then starting at different positions at that word to then check it against the dictionary list. I think that even with an algorithm, there is some luck about how fast the program will be as if the 2nd letter doesn't match any words, then it's automatically not a word. |
| Sept 27th |  9:00pm - 9:45pm  |                                                                                                                                                           After trying to find a way to solve the better problem than binary search manually, I attempted to googled some ways. I didn't really find anything that made clear sense to me though. I am super curious for Mr. Blick to tell us what algorithm we should use in class (hopefully I was close)! |
| Oct 7th   | 10:15pm - 11:15pm | During this time I wrote the insert function in my trie class. I made sure that my insert function checks the next node everytime to check to see if the next node doesn't exist, and if it doesn't I would create a new node. Also, I had forgotten about setting the end letter of the word to be true until I was near the end of writing this function, and just wrote a temporary placeholder that worked but was inefficient (I'll just change later). | |
| Oct 8th   |  8:45am - 9:55am  |                                            I wrote the lookup function that checks to see if the word given as a parameter is a word in the dictionary. Mr. Blick helped edit my insert function to actually work by checking to see if the next node is exists, and to create the next node if it currently null. I also fixed my Spell Check class by creating a trie that keeps track of the misspelled word and only adds unique misspelled words to it. |
| Oct 8th   | 9:55am - 10:35am  |                                                                                                                                       Mr. Blick helped me debug my code! I had my for-loops ending one check too soon due to having hit run word.length() - 1, so I changed it to just word.length(). On top of that, in my spell check class, I wasn't updating the current word each time so it was either returning 0 or the amount of words in the text. |
